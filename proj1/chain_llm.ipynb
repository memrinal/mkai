      "📝 Summary:  The text describes a negative experience with a purchased ergonomic chair. Despite receiving it damaged, the individual assembled it due to needing a new one urgently. However, the chair lacks lumbar support and the seat cushion deflated within two weeks, causing more pain than the old chair. Additionally, the armrests are described as flimsy. The author advises others to save their money and purchase a different chair, implying that this particular one is of poor quality.\n",
      "📊 Sentiment:  The sentiment of the summary can be classified as negative. The text describes a dissatisfying experience with the ergonomic chair, implying that it is of poor quality due to issues like damage upon arrival, lack of lumbar support, deflated seat cushion, and flimsy armrests, which have caused more pain rather than alleviating it. The author's advice to save money and purchase a different chair further emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product.\n",
